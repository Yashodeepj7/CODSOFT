I have completed the tasks assigned during my internship as a Web Developer at CodSoft.

Task 1 (landing Page) :- Creating a landing page is a great project for those who are new to web development. This project only requires basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. By creating a landing page, you'll learn how to design columns, divide sections, arrange items, and add headers and footers. The key to a successful landing page is to let your creativity flow and create an impressive design. You should pay attention to the layout, padding, color palette, boxes, and other design elements. Make sure to use CSS properly to avoid overlapping elements. In conclusion, creating a landing page is a fantastic way to apply your HTML and CSS skills, while also exercising your creativity to develop a visually appealing and user-friendly design.

1. Header Section: Add your name or a logo at the top. You can also include a brief introduction or tagline to give visitors an idea of what your portfolio is about.

Task 3 (Calculater) : To create a basic calculator using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, you need to develop an interactive interface that features buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. The calculator should possess a display screen that shows the user input and results. To align the buttons, you can utilize the CSS grid system. To handle user input and perform calculations, use event listeners, if-else statements, operators, and loops. While this project requires some skill, it can be accomplished with basic knowledge of these technologies.
